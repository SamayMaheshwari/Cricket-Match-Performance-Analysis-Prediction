Cricket Match Performance Analysis and Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze cricket match data and predict the team performance using Linear Regression. The model uses historical match data to predict how many runs a team is likely to score in a match based on several factors such as overs played, wickets taken, recent performance, and the teams involved.

The Flask-based web application allows users to input various match details, select teams, and get predictions on the runs scored by a team based on historical performance.

Features
Data Visualization: Visualize team performance, runs distribution, and correlations between different features of the dataset.

Prediction Model: Linear regression model that predicts the number of runs scored by a team based on different factors.

Interactive Web Interface: A simple web UI where users can input match details, including batting and bowling teams, overs played, wickets, and more.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Flask

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-match-performance-prediction.git
cd cricket-match-performance-prediction
2. Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Dataset
The dataset used for training the prediction model is ipl_data.csv. It contains data about cricket matches, including details such as:

Batting team

Bowling team

Runs scored

Wickets taken

Overs played

Other performance metrics

Make sure that the dataset is in the same directory as the script.

4. Running the application
To run the Flask application, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can access the web interface on your browser.

5. Web Interface
The web interface allows you to:

Select the batting team and bowling team from dropdown menus.

Input the number of overs, runs, wickets, and the performance of the last 5 overs.

Get the predicted runs for the given match configuration.

6. Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to help understand match data and relationships:

A count plot showing the number of matches played by each batting team and bowling team.

A histogram showing the distribution of runs.

A box plot showing the runs per batting team.

A line plot showing runs vs overs.

A heatmap showing the correlation between various numerical features.

These visualizations are saved as static images in the static/ directory.

7. Improving the Model
Feature Engineering: Add additional features to improve prediction accuracy (e.g., player-specific statistics, historical team performance).

Model Enhancement: Experiment with other machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Trees for better predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search to tune hyperparameters of the model for better performance.

Files in the Repository
app.py: The main Flask application.

ipl_data.csv: The dataset used for model training.

templates/: Folder containing HTML files.

static/: Folder to store static files (e.g., visualizations).

requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries for the project.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict cricket team performance based on historical data. The application can be further extended with additional machine learning models and enhanced UI/UX design for better user interaction.

Future Scope
Use more advanced machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.

Implement real-time match prediction using live match data feeds.

Incorporate more complex player statistics for detailed predictions.
